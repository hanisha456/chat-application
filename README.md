A chat application using server socket programming in Java involves creating a multi-threaded server that listens for incoming client connections and facilitates communication between them. The server uses `ServerSocket` to accept client connections, each of which is handled by a separate thread to enable concurrent messaging. Clients connect to the server using `Socket`, send messages, and receive broadcasted messages from other clients. This setup allows real-time, bidirectional communication, making it suitable for instant messaging applications. The implementation leverages Java's robust networking libraries to manage connections, handle I/O operations, and ensure message synchronization and delivery.
